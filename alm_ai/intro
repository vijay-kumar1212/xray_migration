Python is very simple, readable and simple syntax rich ai ecosystem due to these python is highly demanded.
we have a lot of pre built packages, and rapid prototype(working project)
google colab we can code here as well
what is dynamically typed programme?
python automatically determines data types at run time, that's why it's called as dynamic data type


Why PAT is better for high-volume requests:

Performance: PAT uses Bearer token authentication - simpler, faster, no base64 encoding overhead
Rate Limits: Self-hosted Jira typically has more generous rate limits than Cloud
Simpler: One token vs email+token combination
Less overhead: Direct Bearer auth vs Basic auth encoding
Optimized XrayAPIClient for High-Volume Requests

A Personal Access Token is:

A long-lived token tied to a specific user account

Used mainly for REST API authentication

Acts like a password replacement

Can have scoped permissions (read, write, admin etc.)

Characteristics:

User-based authentication

Usually configurable expiration

Can be revoked anytime

Good for automation scripts, CI/CD, integrations

2️⃣ API Token

An API token is a generic term. Its meaning depends on the system.

In tools like:

Jira

Xray

An API token is:

A token generated from your account (like Atlassian API token)

Used instead of password for basic auth

Often paired with email + token

Example (Atlassian Cloud):

auth = (email, api_token)


So in many systems:
👉 PAT = API Token
👉 Sometimes they are just named differently.

🔹 Key Technical Differences (General View)
Feature	PAT	API Token
Tied to user	Yes	Usually yes
Scope control	Often granular	Sometimes limited
Expiry control	Usually configurable	Depends on platform
Recommended over password	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Designed for automation	Yes	Yes
🔹 Which Is Recommended for Large Regression Runs?

When you're:

Updating thousands of test executions

Running CI/CD regression pipelines

Parallel automation jobs

Hitting APIs heavily

✅ Recommended: PAT (or OAuth2 Client Credentials if available)

Why?

1️⃣ Better Security

No password exposure

Can be revoked without affecting user login

2️⃣ Better for Automation

Designed specifically for script/API usage

Cleaner for headless systems

3️⃣ Stability Under Load

Tokens are stateless

No session-based authentication

Works better in parallel executions

🔥 Even Better for High Volume: OAuth2 (Client Credentials Flow)

If you're using Xray Cloud:

Instead of:

email + API token


Use:

client_id + client_secret → get JWT access token


This is:

More scalable

More production-grade

Better for CI/CD

Recommended by Xray for API-heavy integrations

🔹 For Your Regression Use Case

Since you're doing automation (Selenium + API testing):

If using Jira Cloud:

➡ Use API Token

If using Xray Cloud REST API:

➡ Use OAuth2 client credentials flow
(Not PAT)

If using Jira Data Center:

➡ Use PAT

🚀 Final Recommendation (For Large Volume Regression Updates)

If you are updating test case status in bulk:

Use token-based auth (NOT password)

Use connection pooling (requests.Session())

Implement retry logic (429, 5xx handling)

Use batching (don’t update one-by-one if API supports bulk)
